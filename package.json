  "description": "I am trying to link construction submittal logs with submittal tracking on the Procore app, and subsequently link this with construction procurement logs. These logs are often 'offline' and PMs have to manually input duplicate data into these logs. Because of the duplicate and tedious nature of this work, logs are not always maintained and this can put a project in jeapordy. Linking procuement logs with submittal tracking will streamline the procurement log update process and allow teams to quickly target what materials to follow up and hone in on.",
